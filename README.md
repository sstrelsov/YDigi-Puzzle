This repo maintains Spencer's code for the final project for CPSC 383. It is a comprehensive state machine and timer that allows the user to engage with a puzzle box, to be built by Tanya Shibu. The user must solve three tasks within the allotted time, assigned by the user's self-selected difficulty mode.
